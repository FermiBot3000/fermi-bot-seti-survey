## 2. Planetary System

### 2.1 GJ 273 b — **HABITABLE ZONE SUPER-EARTH**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|

## 3. METI: Sónar Calling (2017)

### 3.1 The Transmission
In October 2017, scientists transmitted a deliberate message toward Luyten's Star:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Project** | Sónar Calling GJ 273b |
| **Transmitter** | EISCAT antenna, Tromsø, Norway |
| **Frequency** | 929.0 MHz |
| **Transmission Dates** | October 16-18, 2017 |
| **Signal Duration** | 33 minutes total |
| **Content** | Binary-encoded math, music (Sónar festival artists) |
| **EIRP** | ~1 MW |

### 3.2 Timeline for Response
| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Transmission sent | October 2017 |
| Signal arrives at GJ 273 | ~2030 |
| Earliest possible reply arrives | ~2042 |

**We are not yet within the response window.** Any reply to Sónar Calling would not arrive until approximately 2042.

### 3.3 Ethical Considerations
This METI transmission was controversial:
- No international consultation
- "Planetary decision" made unilaterally
- Ongoing debate about METI protocols

## 4. Data Availability

### 4.1 Breakthrough Listen Archive

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Archive ID** | GJ 273 / HIP 36208 |
| **Data Volume** | ~171 GB |
| **Telescope** | Green Bank Telescope 100m |
| **Frequency Coverage** | 1.1-2.8 GHz (L and S-band) |
| **Observations** | Multiple epochs 2016-2020 |

### 4.2 Scientific Interest
- Pre-selected as Breakthrough Listen target due to proximity
- Interest increased after planet confirmation (2017)
- METI transmission added urgency to monitoring

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis

### 5.1 EIRP Detection Threshold

At 12.4 light-years with GBT L-band:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Distance** | 12.37 ly = 3.79 pc |
| **SEFD (GBT)** | ~10 Jy |
| **Minimum Detectable EIRP** | ~3 GW |

### 5.2 What We Could Detect

| Technology | EIRP | Detectable? |
|------------|------|-------------|
| Arecibo-class directed beacon | 10¹³ W | ✅ Yes |
| Planetary radar system | 10¹² W | ✅ Yes |
| Powerful radio telescope in TX mode | 10¹⁰ W | ✅ Yes |
| Earth aggregate radio leakage | 10⁷ W | ❌ No |

## 6. Search Results

## 7. Habitability Assessment

### 7.1 GJ 273 b Environment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Stellar Flux** | 1.06× Earth's (favorable) |
| **Tidal Locking** | Likely (18.6-day orbit) |
| **Atmospheric Retention** | Possible (low stellar activity) |
| **Water Potential** | Could support surface liquid water |

### 7.2 Comparison with Other HZ Planets

| Planet | Distance | Mass | Stellar Flux | Star Activity |
|--------|----------|------|--------------|---------------|
| GJ 273 b | 12.4 ly | 2.9 M⊕ | 1.06× | LOW |
| Proxima b | 4.2 ly | 1.3 M⊕ | 0.65× | HIGH |
| TRAPPIST-1 e | 40.7 ly | 0.7 M⊕ | 0.66× | MODERATE |

GJ 273 b's combination of Earth-like stellar flux and quiet host star makes it an excellent habitability candidate.

## 8. Conclusions

**Result:** ❌ NULL — No Technosignatures Detected

Luyten's Star shows no evidence of radio technosignatures in 171 GB of Breakthrough Listen data. This null result is obtained **before** the potential response window to the 2017 METI transmission.

### What We Can Rule Out:
- Existing high-power radio beacons directed at Earth
- Active radar systems above ~3 GW EIRP
- Continuous narrowband transmissions in L/S-band

### What Remains Possible:
- Response to Sónar Calling (wouldn't arrive until ~2042)
- Lower-power or intermittent transmissions
- Non-radio communications
- Civilizations not broadcasting in our direction

---

## 9. Future Monitoring

### 9.1 METI Response Window
Special attention should be paid starting around **2040-2045** for any response to the Sónar Calling transmission. Even a null result during this window would be scientifically meaningful.

### 9.2 Recommended Observations
1. **Continued monitoring** through potential response window
2. **Sensitivity improvements** — FAST observations
3. **929 MHz monitoring** — same frequency as METI transmission
4. **Optical SETI** — complementary search methods

*Luyten's Star is unique as both a SETI target and the recipient of deliberate human transmission. The 2042+ response window makes continued monitoring essential.*
