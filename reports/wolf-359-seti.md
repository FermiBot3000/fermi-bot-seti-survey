# SETI Analysis: Wolf 359 (CN Leonis)

**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Analyst:** Fermi Bot 3000  
**Target:** Wolf 359 (CN Leonis, GJ 406)  
**Distance:** 7.9 light-years (2.4 pc)  
**Status:** ⚠️ NO DATA AVAILABLE (Flare Star Gap)  

---

## Executive Summary

Wolf 359 is the fifth closest star system to Earth, yet **no dedicated SETI observations exist in publicly available archives**. This represents a significant gap in our systematic survey of the nearest stellar neighborhood. The lack of data is likely attributable to the star's extreme flare activity, which complicates radio observations.

## 1. Target Properties

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Wolf 359 (CN Leonis, GJ 406) |
| **Spectral Type** | M6.5Ve (Red Dwarf, Flare Star) |
| **Distance** | 7.86 light-years (2.41 pc) |
| **Apparent Magnitude** | 13.5 |
| **Mass** | 0.09 M☉ |
| **Luminosity** | 0.0014 L☉ |
| **Rotation Period** | ~2.7 hours (extremely rapid) |
| **Known Planets** | Two candidates: Wolf 359 b (~40 M⊕), Wolf 359 c (~3.8 M⊕) |
| **Age** | 100-350 million years |

### Flare Activity
Wolf 359 is classified as a UV Ceti-type flare star with extreme magnetic activity:
- Flares occur multiple times per day
- Optical brightness can increase by factors of 100+
- Radio bursts during flares reach mJy levels
- Coronal mass ejections are frequent

## 2. Data Availability Search

### 2.1 Breakthrough Listen Archive
**Search Result:** NO DEDICATED OBSERVATIONS

Wolf 359 does not appear in:
- BL Nearby Stars program
- BL GBT Archive
- BL Parkes/Murriyang Archive
- BL Exotica Catalog

### 2.2 SETI Institute Observations
**Search Result:** NO PUBLIC DATA

Allen Telescope Array data for Wolf 359 not publicly available.

### 2.3 Historical SETI Observations
Project Phoenix and other historical surveys may have observed Wolf 359, but raw data is not digitally archived.

## 3. Why the Gap Exists

### 3.1 Flare Star Complications
Flare stars present unique challenges for SETI:

1. **Radio Interference:** Stellar flares produce broadband radio bursts that can mask or mimic signals
2. **Variable Background:** Background noise level varies significantly over short timescales
3. **Scientific Deprioritization:** SETI programs may have prioritized quieter stars
4. **Observation Windows:** Useful data requires observing between flares

### 3.2 Alternative Interpretation
Flare stars could actually be *more* interesting for SETI:
- High UV flux drives prebiotic chemistry
- Magnetic activity provides shelter from cosmic rays
- Young, active stars may host developing technological civilizations

## 4. Theoretical Detection Limits

If we assume typical BL/GBT sensitivity at 7.9 light-years:

| Telescope | Theoretical EIRP Limit | Comparison |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| GBT 100m (L-band) | ~500 MW | Arecibo planetary radar: 1 TW |
| FAST 500m (L-band) | ~100 MW | Military radar: ~100 MW |
| ATA (L-band) | ~50 GW | Multiple TV stations combined |

## 5. Known Planets

### Wolf 359 b (Candidate)
- **Minimum Mass:** ~43 Earth masses
- **Orbital Period:** ~2,900 days
- **Status:** Needs confirmation (possible stellar activity alias)

### Wolf 359 c (Candidate)
- **Minimum Mass:** ~3.8 Earth masses
- **Orbital Period:** ~2.7 days (very close-in)
- **Status:** Rocky planet candidate in challenging environment

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Observation Priority: HIGH
Despite flare activity complications, Wolf 359 should be observed:
- **Fifth closest star** to Earth
- **Multiple planet candidates**
- Modern signal processing can filter flare interference

### 6.2 Proposed Observation Strategy
1. **Multi-epoch observations** to catch quiescent periods
2. **Broadband monitoring** to characterize flare behavior
3. **Coincidence rejection** using multiple beams
4. **Simultaneous optical monitoring** to flag active flare periods

### 6.3 Recommended Facilities
- FAST (highest sensitivity)
- GBT (L/S/C band coverage)
- ATA (continuous monitoring possible)

## 7. Conclusions

**Result:** INCONCLUSIVE — NO DATA AVAILABLE

Wolf 359 represents one of the most significant gaps in systematic SETI coverage of the nearest stars. At only 7.9 light-years, this fifth-closest stellar system should be a high-priority target despite observational challenges posed by its flare star nature.

**This gap must be addressed.** Future observations should prioritize Wolf 359 to complete our survey of the immediate solar neighborhood.
