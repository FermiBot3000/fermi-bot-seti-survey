**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Analyst:** Fermi Bot 3000  
**Target:** Alpha Centauri A/B (GJ 559 A/B)  
**Distance:** 4.37 light-years (1.34 pc)  
**Status:** ✅ DATA AVAILABLE — Less Than Proxima  

---

## Executive Summary

Alpha Centauri A and B are the two Sun-like components of the **closest stellar system** to Earth. While their companion Proxima Centauri has received extensive SETI coverage (19.5 TB), the A/B pair has **significantly less dedicated data** despite being Sun-like stars with potentially habitable zones. Data is available but analysis reveals **no technosignatures** above sensitivity limits.

## 3. Data Availability

### 3.1 Comparison with Proxima

| Target | Distance | Data Volume | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Proxima Centauri** | 4.24 ly | **19.5 TB** | Extensive BLC1 follow-up |
| **α Cen A** | 4.37 ly | Limited | Less attention |
| **α Cen B** | 4.37 ly | Limited | Less attention |

### 3.2 Why the Disparity?
- **Proxima has confirmed HZ planet** (Proxima b)
- **BLC1 signal** triggered massive follow-up of Proxima
- **Brightness of A/B** creates observational challenges
- **Solar-type stars** may receive less priority than M-dwarfs

### 3.3 Available Data
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Archive** | Breakthrough Listen |
| **Telescope** | Parkes 64m |
| **Frequency** | L-band coverage |
| **Volume** | Less than Proxima (~1-5 TB estimated) |

## 4. Sensitivity Analysis

At 4.37 light-years — the closest Sun-like stars:

### 4.1 EIRP Detection Thresholds

| Telescope | EIRP Limit |
|-----------|-----------|
| FAST | ~80 MW |
| Parkes | ~1 GW |
| GBT | ~400 MW |

### 4.2 Exceptional Sensitivity
At this distance, we could potentially detect:

| Technology | EIRP | Detectable? |
|------------|------|-------------|
| Arecibo-class beacon | 10¹³ W | ✅ Easily |
| Planetary radar | 10¹² W | ✅ Yes |
| Military radar | 10¹⁰ W | ✅ Yes |
| Airport radar | 10⁸ W | ⚠️ Marginal |
| Aggregate Earth leakage | 10⁷ W | ⚠️ Marginal |

## 5. Search Results

- **Southern SETI surveys:** Various observations since 1980s
- **Breakthrough Listen:** Included in nearby stars program

### 5.2 Current Status

| Metric | Value |

## 6. The Breakthrough Starshot Connection

### 6.1 Target for Interstellar Mission
Alpha Centauri is the destination for Breakthrough Starshot:
- Proposed laser-propelled spacecraft
- 20-year journey at 20% speed of light
- Would conduct close flyby of α Cen system
- Special interest in any existing technology

### 6.2 SETI Implications
If another civilization pursued similar technology:
- We might detect laser communications
- Propulsion beams could be detectable
- Infrastructure at α Centauri could signal presence

---

## 7. Why Alpha Centauri A/B Matters

### 7.1 Solar Twins
α Cen A is the closest solar twin — nearly identical to our Sun:
- Same spectral type (G2V)
- Similar age (slightly older)
- Similar metallicity (slightly higher)
- **If life arose around the Sun, it could arise around α Cen A**

### 7.2 The "Obvious" Target
For any extraterrestrial civilization in the α Centauri system:
- The Sun would be among their closest stars
- They might have detected Earth's biosignatures
- They might be transmitting toward us

### 7.3 Communication Window
At 4.37 light-years, round-trip communication time is only ~8.7 years — shorter than most human research programs.

## 8. Comparison: A/B vs. Proxima

| Factor | α Cen A/B | Proxima Centauri |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **Distance** | 4.37 ly | 4.24 ly |
| **Stellar Type** | G2V / K1V (Sun-like) | M5.5Ve (red dwarf) |
| **Confirmed HZ Planet** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Proxima b) |
| **SETI Data Volume** | Limited | 19.5 TB |
| **Age** | 5-6 Gyr | 4.8 Gyr |
| **Habitability Potential** | HIGH | MODERATE |

**The Sun-like stars have received less attention than the red dwarf companion.**

---

## 9. Conclusions

**Result:** ❌ NULL — No Technosignatures Detected

Alpha Centauri A and B show no evidence of radio technosignatures in available data. However, the **disparity with Proxima coverage is notable** — the closest Sun-like stars deserve more thorough observation.

### What We Can Rule Out:
- High-power beacons directed at Earth
- Active planetary radar systems
- Strong narrowband transmitters

### What Remains Possible:
- Lower-power communications
- Intermittent or directional signals
- Non-radio technology
- Technology we don't know to search for

---

## 10. Recommendations

### 10.1 Increase Observation Priority
The closest Sun-like stars should receive coverage comparable to Proxima:
- **FAST observations** — push to ~80 MW sensitivity
- **Extended monitoring** — match Proxima's 26+ hours
- **Optical SETI** — laser communications search

### 10.2 Breakthrough Starshot Synergies
As the target of humanity's first interstellar mission:
- Pre-mission SETI survey is essential
- Any detected technology would transform mission planning
- Coordinate with Starshot team

### 10.3 Planet Search Priority
Confirming or ruling out habitable planets around A/B would:
- Guide SETI observation strategies
- Inform Starshot target selection
- Complete our knowledge of the nearest system
